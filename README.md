YASEngine(Yet Another Simple Engine) will be simple game engine written in C++ with Vulkan API and other APIs in the future.

In the beginning during creating engine and simultanously learning Vulkan, code which you find here is modified code from Vulkan tutorial -> https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Introduction 
During my learning process this code will be changing.

Over time I will be gaining more knowledge about Vulkan and game engine architecture to create first version of this engine which allow me to create game similar to Wolfenstein 3D.

Through process of creating this engine I'm learning from various of sources.
Few of them are:

All resources from Khronos Group git hub -> https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Khronosdotorg/blob/master/api/vulkan/resources.md

Of cource specification -> https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0/html/vkspec.html#introduction

Vulkan tutorial -> https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Introduction

Harrys Gould online book about Vulkan -> {
  https://github.com/HarryLovesCode/Vulkan-API-Book
  https://harrylovescode.gitbooks.io/vulkan-api/content/index.html
}

From Parminders Singh book "Learning Vulkan" -> https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Vulkan-Parminder-Singh-ebook/dp/B01FSO1D2Q/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8

Everything which i found in google.
