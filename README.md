# YASEngine
YASEngine(Yet Another Simple Engine) will be simple game engine written in C++ with Vulkan API and other APIs in the future. Over time I will be gaining more knowledge about Vulkan and game engine architecture to create first version of this engine which allow me to create game similar to Wolfenstein 3D.

Over time I will be gaining more knowledge about Vulkan and game engine architecture to create first version of this engine which allow me to create game similar to Wolfenstein 3D.

Thrue process of creating this engine I'm learning from various of sources.
Few of them are:

All resources from Khronos Group git hub -> https://github.com/KhronosGroup/Khronosdotorg/blob/master/api/vulkan/resources.md

Of cource specification -> https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.0/html/vkspec.html#introduction

Vulkan tutorial -> https://vulkan-tutorial.com/Introduction

Harrys Gould online book about Vulkan -> {

}

From Parminders Singh book "Learning Vulkan" -> https://www.amazon.com/Learning-Vulkan-Parminder-Singh-ebook/dp/B01FSO1D2Q/ref=asap_bc?ie=UTF8
